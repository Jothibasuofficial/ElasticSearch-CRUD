# ElasticSearch-CRUD

A java application for CRUD operations using Elasticsearch.

**CRUD** stands for create, read, update, and delete. These are all **operations** that are needed to effectively administer persistent data storage. Luckily, these also have logical equivalents in HTTP methods, which makes it easy to interact using standard methods.

In this tutorial, we will look at how to perform basic CRUD operations using Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch has a very well designed REST API, and the CRUD operations are targeted at documents.

To understand how to perform CRUD operations, we will cover the following APIs. These APIs fall under the category of Document APIs that deal with documents:
* Index API
* Get API
* Update API
* Delete API
